# redshiftAdjust

This script allows manually adjusting the brightness and temperature of the screen directly from the commandline and without using the geographical position.
I've created it to be able to bind keyboard shortcuts to quickly increase/decrease brightness/temperature.

You can save the script and the two .dat files in a directory and run (or set your keyboards shortcuts) as follows:

`./adjScreen.sh bUp`
`./adjScreen.sh bDown`
to respectively increase and decrease brightness,
and
`./adjScreen.sh gUp`
`./adjScreen.sh gDown`

to respectively increase and decrease temperature
